This is a Python script that scrapes the Able Carry site for the Thirteen Daybag.
In 2022, this bag was out-of-stock and had infrequent restocks. I made this script to notify myself when the bag was available to purchase so that I could be one of the first ones - bonus is that Able Carry gives you a discount and adds a goodie with it when they restock.
I ran this script on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine daily and would be notified via email with status updates.

P.S. I did get my bag :)
